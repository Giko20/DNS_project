# sweeft_DNS_project
Write a web application using Flask Framework to display the DNS traffic of the hots computer. The
application needs to monitor the live network traffic of the host system and display up to 100 entries
after which it must start dropping the oldest entries. The DNS entries must appear on the screen in a
DataGrid. All the DNS requests must be coupled with their respective responses, therefore each entry
in the DataGrid must contain the following info:
1) Timestamp of the request made in human readable form (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
2) Domain Name the request was made for (google.com, 1tv.ge, etc. )
3) DNS response containing the IPs for the inquired Domain Names
You can use any library you want to complete this task. Use the best practices for each methodology
used, including but not limited to proper variable naming, code commenting and proper git wotkflow.
It is highly recommended to use OOP.
